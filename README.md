# Fractal Brain

An advanced AI model implementing a fractal neuron architecture with enhanced modules for emotion, curiosity, and explainability. The Fractal Brain integrates components like BERT and GPT-2 for language understanding and generation, respectively, and employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for latent space encoding.

## Introduction
Fractal Brain is an experimental AI model that simulates a brain-like architecture using fractal neurons and enhanced modules for emotional modulation, curiosity, and explainability. It integrates state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT and GPT-2 for language comprehension and generation.

The goal of this project is to explore novel AI architectures inspired by biological neurons and to create an AI that can learn continuously, adapt, and provide explanations for its outputs.

## Features
- **Fractal Neuron Architecture**: A recursive neural network structure that grows and prunes itself dynamically based on activity.
- **Emotional Modulation**: Incorporates an emotional module that influences processing based on simulated emotions.
- **Curiosity Module**: Evaluates novelty in inputs and encourages exploration and learning of new information.
- **Explainability**: Provides explanations for its responses by highlighting influential neurons and internal processes.
- **Integration with BERT and GPT-2**: Uses pre-trained models for language understanding and generation.
- **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**: Encodes inputs into a latent space for efficient processing and reconstruction.
- **Long-Term Memory**: Stores experiences and retrieves relevant information during processing.
- **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Adjusts the learning rate dynamically based on performance and novelty.
- **Continuous Learning**: Implements a buffer to learn from new experiences over time.
- **Gradio Interface**: Interactive web interface for chatting and experimenting with the model.

## Architecture Overview
(Include an architecture diagram illustrating the components and their interactions.)

The Fractal Brain architecture consists of multiple interconnected modules:
- **Input Processing**: Tokenization and embedding of input text using BERT and custom embeddings.
- **Comprehension (Wernicke's Module)**: Understanding of intents and entities from the input.
- **Latent Space Encoding (VAE)**: Encoding input embeddings into a latent representation.
- **Fractal Brain Processing**: Recursive processing through fractal neurons influenced by emotional and curiosity modules.
- **Response Generation (Broca's Module)**: Generating responses using GPT-2 based on processed information.
- **Explainability**: Generating explanations for the AI's responses.
